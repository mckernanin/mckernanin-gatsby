A recent update to workbox broke the skip waiting functionality in a service worker generated by CRAv3. <br />
I'm using [cra-append-sw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cra-append-sw) to patch the service worker generated by react-scripts.
All that I needed to do was change `workbox.skipWaiting();` to `workbox.core.skipWaiting();` to get it working again. <br/>
The new `workbox-window` package was helpful in testing this behavior, setting a reload to fire on install, etc. This article was helpful in setting it up: https://medium.com/@webmaxru/workbox-4-implementing-refresh-to-update-version-flow-using-the-workbox-window-module-41284967e79c
