I'm working on a side project right now that has a lot of user / capability interactions, and I'm not as familiar with those parts of WordPress, so I've found myself searching the developer docs for functions fairly often. You can add this site as a custom search engine in Chrome to speed things up.

1.  Right click the address bar in Chrome, and click "Edit Search Engines...". This will bring up a dialog of all the search engines in Chrome.
2.  Scroll all the way to the bottom, and addÂ a new search engine. I called mine "WordPress Developers" and used they keyword "wpdev". The URL you need is https://developer.wordpress.org/?s=%s. This tells chrome where to put your search query. Here's an example: ![Screen Shot 2016-08-07 at 9.56.09 AM](https://mckernan.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-07-at-9.56.09-AM.png)
3.  Search the developer docs at breakneck speed! Now I just open a new tab, type "wpdev", hit tab, enter my search query, and go!
